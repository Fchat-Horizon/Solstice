 *
 * Message-level union merge of chat logs, used by the device sync feature.
 * Unlike the zip importer (which only skips or overwrites whole log files),
 * this merges the incoming message set into the local binary logs so both
 * devices end up with the union of all messages, and rebuilds the `.idx`
 * day index alongside. Pure Node - no `core` or `@electron/remote` imports,
 * mirroring `../exporter/backup-export-cli.ts`.
 *
 * Binary log conversion and `.idx` building are delegated to `../log-backup`
 * (`binaryLogToJson`, `jsonLogToBinary`, `buildLogIndexBuffer`, which also
 * back the exporter and CLI); this module adds only the message-level
 * union-merge and the sync zip's path handling.
 *
 * The merge never holds a whole conversation. A batch bounds what arrives, not
 * what is already stored, so a large stored conversation would otherwise set
 * the memory ceiling on its own. Instead a bounded scan walks the stored log in
 * windows reading only record framing, and everything after it works one day at
 * a time, which the `.idx` already partitions the conversation by. A
 * conversation that only grows at the end skips the rebuild entirely and is
 * extended in place. Peak memory is set by the largest single day plus the
 * incoming batch.
